<p>The Silver-Sliver Galaxy (C 23) (NGC 891) is a spiral galaxy viewed edge on located about 30 million light years away in the constellation of Andromeda.
  The dust lane can be seen as well as the glow from the galactic core. This galaxy is said to be very similar in size and structure to the Milky Way.

  <p>Looking at some information online I realised that there was a Quasar close to the galaxy some 10 billion light years distant, an active galactic nucleus outshining its entire galaxy.
    This can just about be seen im the image
    as a very faint couple of pixels. It was still impressive being ablt to pick up ab object that distant. The quasar is called QSO J0222+4221 pointed out in the image below:
